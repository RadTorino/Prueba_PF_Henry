"Used to be a fun place with friendly baristas who knew your drink when you came in and joked with and cared about customers. Lately there seems to be a big turnover and the staff seems stressed and uptight and tell you that you can ""feel free to complain to the manager, the business cards are on the counter!"" when you try to make a joke. Very different from past years - the sensitivity training apparently didn't improve the general atmosphere.",Service,negative

"My experience about most Starbucks
locations is that the coffee is way overpriced. I have been a Gold card
member since 2009. I supported the part time workers and was pleased to
know that they received benefits for part time employment. However my criticism is more about the company
and its former CEO who implied that the current presidential administration
is racists. Therefore I do not patronize
Starbucks anymore because of their
false political views. I am sacrificing a
gold card.  Nothing personal against its staff which generally are hard working Americans. I realize the company has its lberal views and ridiculous bias trainning. However their seems to be much bias for our President.There are plenty of other
Mom and Pop coffee establishments
available which I  am happy to support.",Coffee,negative

I have worked at a Starbucks before and the first thing they always teach you is to be super friendly and attentive to what the customer wants. Came in with my boyfriend and he told her to scan Starbucks rewards on his phone she proceeds and says ‚Äú for what??‚Äù With attitude. We had a reward on the app she then said we couldn‚Äôt redeem it and continue to take our order as if she hated her job. Utterly bad customer service. Trash of an employee. We always come in and a sweet older lady helps us but this barista was younger and rude. Get her fired.,Service,negative

I personally, think I am going to go to the safeway starbucks for now on, or maybe the Starbucks further south down el comino, but I am fed up with this location.

If this was my only experience with starbucks, id have decided to never go to one again.

The only reason this location received two stars is because its at least a Starbucks and ive been a customer for the company for over 10 years now.

I am 10 year Army Vet with an honorable discharge so I have credibility, yes I am peeved but Id never lie to get back or anything like that. Also, my veteran status shows a level of mental fortitude and sanity so I am not just some crazy person.

"This location always takes a bit longer than other Starbucks locations and they have messed up my order a few times, the first time I let it slide but they kept making the drink with caffeine when I was asking for it without any, so it takes longer sometimes to have them remake the drink as well. I feel bad about it but when it's wrong it's wrong. Ordering ahead seems to work well unless you get stuck in a line of cars also waiting for their orders ahead of you.",Service,negative

Okay, back to the review.
I am a frequent Starbucks person. I‚Äôve been to so many in the US and in Europe and this has been the best one.
We are in from out of town and I will say the staff has the best personalities. They are very informative, greet when you walk in, and even come from the other side of the counter to help. One lady actually came to make sure my husband liked his drink because it was something new (to us) and don‚Äôt know they have unsweet chia tea latte for him. We came 6/19/18 at 9:20am.",Service,positive

"If I could give this place 0 stars, I would. Every time I go in there, they make at least one thing wrong. Today was my breaking point. 1. The cashier added a drink I did not ask for. 2. The barista made my first drink incorrectly, then proceeded to make the second drink, spilled what was already inside with the cup touching the counter, and continued to make my drink in the same cup. 3. the ‚Äúmanager‚Äù or barista in charge kept apologizing sarcastically, slammed other orders around  and fussing at the other employees. I was chatting with the customers waiting and they said the same thing I was saying. I haven‚Äôt been to this starbucks in a while due to this reason, but I tried today to see if there was any improvement. Boy was I wrong.",Service,negative

"2020.01-28/0839 on Register 2. What an AMAZING experience!! Since I never frequent Starbucks, I knew what I wanted but I didn't know what it's called. I went after a San Bernardino Sheriff named Mike and he knew what he wanted. How embarrassing!

So the reason I'm writing this is because the lady that helped me was the absolute best (she's the only one with natural blonde long hair)! I didn't know what to order because I'm not familiar with Starbucks. I'm a tea drinker. I told her what I wanted and she was so sweet to help me!!! I told her I just wanted coffee with cream. She then asked if It liked a lot of cream and I exclaimed, yes!!! She then recommended the Misto and also offered any flavors and even sugar-free flavors since I mentioned that I didn't want any sugar. How knowledgeable. It's like having the best bartender or chef ever! She explained that the Misto is half coffee and half cream. Perfection!! I wish I knew her name!! I checked the receipt and didn't see it so this is why I time stamped this review in hopes that she or her supervisor would see this! SHE MADE MY EXPERIENCE and my day with her smile and wonderful demeanor!!! She's perfect. It's rare to find someone who is so personable at this time in the morning!!! I wanted to let her know that my Misto is fantastic! Please commend her and I hope she is someone in management because businesses need more people like her!! She would be an amazing manager!",Service,positive

Very disappointed stopped by the new Starbucks at about 5:10 p.m. to get a cold brew iced caramel coffee Starbucks said they were completely out ask them what time they were open till they said 9:00 I said so you guys would not brew anymore before 9:00 he said it takes too long to do it it's too long of a process that might be the case but I'm not sure why they wouldn't make sure to brew enough to be having enough for the next 4 hours of work so very disappointed in that never once have I been to a Starbucks yet that told me they were out of cold brew so I guess I'm going to go down the road to dunkin' donuts cuz they're never out of cold brew very sad as I'm from Seattle and Starbucks is where I always have went,Coffee,negative

I hope your barista with the dark hair thick eyeliner and accent is held accountable for her rude actions today. If a customer orders a double double *on accident* you should be helping them find a drink similar to what they're looking for. Here I am looking stupid and apologizing while your rolling your eyes and snickering at me. Instead I got treated like I didnt matter by you. Also if I'm asking another worker questions about your product and services and you cut us off and send her to do something is in EXTREME POOR TASTE. I then ask you the same question to where again you ROLLED YOUR EYES AT ME?! It almost felt like you were doing it on purpose. Dont worry you weren't worth my response but I did call your boss. I hope you start treating people with better kindness and compassion. The world has enough hatred. Also the coffee was TERRIBLE AND I LEFT IT. I'll be getting my refund though.,Service,negative

Not sure if the water filter is not working at this store.

"Busy at all times of the day, especially the drive through. Maybe I am too picky but I dislike their coffee/espresso, especially that I do not add any sweeteners to cut the taste. Tastes burned to me. Not my way to give a hard time to the barristas -- after all they do their best to prepare the drinks as ordered, serve customers quickly and be cheerful. Guess that the machines are the issue. Lately, I go there only when my wife requests it (and then she says that it was a mistake). In my humble opinion, the local McDonalds is the place to drivethrough for coffee if you like yours black or with a little milk only.",Coffee,negative

"Really impressed with the layout of this place!
The atmosphere and cleanliness is impeccable! The restrooms are spick and span and the service is fast.

Indoor seating is not allowed due to Covid.  However, they have outdoor seating.

I got the Vanilla cream cold brew and it was delicious. I got my sweetness levels customized as I don‚Äôt like sweeter side drinks.

They have a huge parking but when there are lot of cars for drive-thru then taking your car out from might get tricky. We experienced this difficulty. So, be smart about the parking.

Will definitely recommend this place!",Place,positive

"They are very serious about closing time. I stopped in for a quick snack and the very friendly barista didn't mention any thing about closing time. About halfway into my snack (2 min later), a woman who had been sitting on a stool when I came in informed me and the gentleman who was eating next to me that they were closed. She then stared at us until we picked up our food and left. We both had to finish eating outside on the sidewalk. Most bizzare Starbucks experience ever. Three stars because the woman who made my food was very friendly and I'm not 100% sure the woman who kicked us out actually works there, though she said she did.",Time,neutral

Don't know why but this is easily the slowest Starbucks I've ever been to and I've been to Starbucks from Beijing to Berlin. There was 2 different times that I was there and the barista made the same excuse of dropping something on her hand so she had to work slower. Either she's very clumsy or she is just a slow worker using the same excuse so you don't get mad. The line is always about 6 cars long when I pass and don't recommend getting on the end of that train because it does not move fast. You're best bet is to go inside. It has been noticeably faster when I go in and can see the line in the drive thru is moving at a much slower pace.,Time,negative

Considering they told me to shop else where I will do so. Tim‚Äôs is right near by. Don‚Äôt think Starbucks would appreciate you sending customers away and making them lose money.

"I truly love this place! Coffee is always good, plus they already know how I like it (that's a plus). I visit this location several times a week and I have never had a problem with my order. The reason for the 3 stars is because since I am a regular costumer (like most of the people that visit this location) I like to chitchat with the employees while they are working on my order, just like most people do. I have during the period of the last year that this one employee keeps constantly giving orders to other employees in a very unprofessional tone (a high sign of micromanagement) and most of the times it makes the costumer feels uncomfortable since we are the spectators of such behavior. I have several times seen costumer go away like if they were also told to stop talking to the employee. Today it happened to me, I was enjoying my drink when I made a comment to an employee that came near me while he was arranging things around and this other employee that I am talking about told him to stop talking to me and do his ""friking"" job. I felt insulted since that was very disrespectful towards me as a costumer and sorry for the other employee that looked embarrassed about the situation. I grabbed my drink and left but very displeased. It is a shame that a place where most employees always smile at the costumers while working on their orders and make us feel like friends in a fast paced but harmonious place have employees that disrespect others in front of the costumers showing lack of interpersonal skills and professionalism. I hope management does something about this because I have observed many people leaving the place unhappy and uncomfortable due to this situation.",Service,Negative

"I'm very dry upset and disappointed. My son and I always get a double chocolate chip frap. He paid and was told they didn't have any chocolate chips but it would still taste the same, they were using mocha, my son had no idea what mocha was and they taste horrible and nothing like what we've been getting for years at Starbucks. Neither of us drink coffee and, well, I'm not sure if those people should be working there.",Coffee,Negative
"Very friendly staff.  The location is perfect, and the ambiance is very comfortable and cozy.  Great place to meet neighborhood friends.  5 stars here.

So why 2 stars?  As good as the customer service is, the main attraction is the drinks, which taste watered down (on more than one visit, BTW).  And it's not the ""Starbucks"" style that I'm tasting:  I can go to any number of local starbucks in the grocery stores and get a fuller tasting mocha.

"I've been going to this location for a couple of months and it's a hit-or-miss with the baristas and their customer service. I understand operating a drive-thru is stressful, but I've been to plenty of other Starbucks locations where baristas still acknowledge you for entering their premises. Not only that, they gave me a Venti instead of a Trenta because they were too busy conversing with each other to notice the size difference. You're better off doing mobile ordering at a different Starbucks location, such as the one on Homestead.",Service,Negative

"Like most of us who have gone to Starbucks more than a few times, I have a special order for my coffee. Some Baristas at Starbucks seems to be unable to step away from their well-remembered order and do something a little different however not only was the Westgate location friendly they were actually interested in why I liked mine that way! The manager said that she liked to ask about special orders and she can share that with her customers who say they have similar issues and tastes! Even if she was just being polite I don't care, it made me feel that my special order was not an inconvenience!

I had to call inside using my cell phone to ask them to please come to the window because I had placed a mobile order. They still took 2 more minutes to come to the window.

"If you couldn't tell by my posts and profile already, I'm a gigantic coffee fan.  Not just a coffeeshop fan, but a Chemex in my house and pour over brewer at work type of fan.  I love trying out a new Starbucks or other coffee shop and sharing the news.  This particular coffee shop has served me well for the past year.  The baristas are friendly and the coffee has always been fresh when I've been there.  Due to its location and popularity there could be a wait depending on the time of day...so I understand some of the complaints...its really the only quality, true Starbucks caf√© in this area.

Fortunately for this Starbucks I'm writing their review today and they impressed me with an act I have yet to witness in my coffee journeys.  For the first time at any coffee shop I've reviewed so far, I was asked if I had time for a pour over speciality roast after I placed my order.  A pour over...in Cary, NC and at a Starbucks mind you.  I couldn't say yes fast enough...and it was done right.  The barista was able to make a quality pour over while assisting other customers.  I hope this wasn't only a one time thing and they continue this offering and other caf√©s in the area follow suit.

If you enjoy Starbucks and don't mind the occasional crowd this is a good choice for those in the area.",Coffee,Positive

"Every time I visit this location the service is abominable, but I feel I had an educational experience.  Here's how it went: today I stood waiting to order while the two employees complained loudly about their job and the location.  When they did let me order they seemed pretty unhappy about making a hot chocolate...so yeah.  They filled the drink only about 3/4 full.  It's hot chocolate.  Not a foamy drink.  So I guess what I've learned is that these poor beleaguered employees have been forced to go above and beyond the call of duty by A) talking to costumers B) Figuring out how much to charge for the drink C) Filling the drink.  It's a lot to ask; a tremendous amount of work to ask of two people at a coffee shop.  The moral of the story is this:  Go somewhere else.  Leave these employees to moan and complain in peace.",Service,Negative
