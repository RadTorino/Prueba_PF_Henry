As a result, the service is not and will never be up to Starbucks's standards. This is less about the quality of the food & beverages, and more to do with the quality and friendliness of the servers. I personally have only had to deal with slow service, but that could happen at any time during a rush. The worst stories come from others; I have been around while the building was hosting an added-security event, which required the presence of LEOs; the baristas refused to provide him with a glass of water without charging him. At other foodservice locations in the same building and operated by the same company, not even students are charged for water glasses. That one event does a good job summarizing the apathy and disregard the employees have for their customers. Another critical issue is that this location doesn't accept Starbucks's own rewards program, which is extremely annoying after having signed up for the program just for the convenience of the location being in the same building that I work for. I've personally made a resolution to never purchase another item at this location again.\"\n",
